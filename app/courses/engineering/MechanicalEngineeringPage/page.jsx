                                    Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines that applies the principles of physics, engineering, and materials science for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.
                                    Mechanical engineers work on power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines, as well as power-using machines such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. They also design tools that other engineers need for their work.
