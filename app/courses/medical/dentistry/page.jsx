                                    Dentistry is a branch of medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and conditions of the oral cavity.
                                    Dentists are healthcare professionals who specialize in providing oral health services, including examinations, cleanings, fillings,
                                    extractions, and various surgical procedures. The field of dentistry encompasses several specialties such as orthodontics, periodontics,
                                    endodontics, and oral surgery. Becoming a dentist requires completing a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree followed by optional
                                    postgraduate specialization. Dentists play a crucial role in maintaining overall health, as oral health is closely linked to general well-being.
