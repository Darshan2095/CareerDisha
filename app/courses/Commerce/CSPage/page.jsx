                                    Company Secretary is a professional course that imparts knowledge and training in corporate laws, securities laws, and corporate governance. In India, Company Secretaries are regulated by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI), which is a statutory body established under an Act of Parliament.

                                    The CS qualification involves three levels: CS Foundation, CS Executive, and CS Professional, along with mandatory practical training. Company Secretaries play a pivotal role in ensuring regulatory compliance, good governance practices, and ethical conduct in organizations. They act as a vital link between the company and its board of directors, shareholders, government, and regulatory authorities.
